This is my first model for Half-Life so there are bound to be some bugs here and there. It does work pretty good though.

Installation:
-------------
Just unzip this zip file into your C:/Half-Life directory and run the game. 

If you have trouble just make shure the OBI01.MDL and OBI01.BMP files are in the Half-Life/Valve/Models/Player/Obi01 directory and it should work.

ENJOY!!!
